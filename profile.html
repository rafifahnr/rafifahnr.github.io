    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> Hi everyone! after introducing my full name on the home page,<br>
    i'll tell u a lil bit more about myself here! <br>
    My friends usually call me Rafifah, and i'm from Pati.<br>
    My hobbies include reading, swimming, and video editing.<br>
    Although i only edit videos when i want it, because sometimes i need ideas,<br>
    i really enjoy it!. In addition, i like art. Honestly, <br>
    back in my junior and senior high school, my passion was in art, like painting and digital editing. <br>
    but sorry guys, i cant give u any picture of my design, because my school didn't allow us to bring <br>
    cameras and phones. And my digital edits are saved in my flashdisk, but i'm not sure where is it now. <br><br>

        Oh, and i also love exploring some places, even though <br>
    i dont explore that often, but it really helps refresh my mind! and from that,<br>
    i had the ideas to film the places i visit and do some video editing.<br>
    Besides, i've started a new routine of running or walking at least 5 kilometers without stopping. <br>
    and the fun part is that i do it with my friend! So excited!. <br>
    My goals, is to become a professional programmer. <br>
    I hope i'm always blessed by Allah SWT, always happy and healthy  <br>
    Okay, thats all guys! Thank you. <br><br>
